# Chaucha Insight

Download [insight.zip](https://github.com/proyecto-chaucha/chaucha-insight/releases/download/v1/insight.zip) from 
https://github.com/proyecto-chaucha/chaucha-insight/releases/tag/v1

Since Github does not allow files larger than 100 mb in the repo.

Or you can compile the insight yourself with the patches files.

This should run fine in Ubuntu 16.04 or compatible.
